								<h2>Background</h2>
                                <p>A current resident of Pittsburgh, PA, I grew up in San Diego, California. I attended High Tech High school - a charter school focused on training the next generation of technical leaders.</p>
                                <p>I began writing code around age 8, when I took my first programming class (along with fencing and chess) at a summer camp. I dual-booted my first linux system when I was 14, and shortly afterwards learned how to touch type using the programmer dvorak keyboard layout (I still cannot touch type qwerty). I got my first internship at Packet Video, a tech company in San Diego, when I was 16, and I worked to migrate our existing DevOps infrastructure to use Puppet for configuration management.</p>
                                <h2>Education</h2>
                                <p>In college at the University of California, Irvine, I earned dual degrees in Biology and Electrical Engineering, and graduated magna cum laude. I went on to earn a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineeriing and Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley, and my dissertation focused on optical voltage sensing in the micro- and kilo-volt range.</p>
                                <p>
                                <h2>Work ( <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HaXvspQut0UmVicgFhwYP9MH7nAvBhVG/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113015989527871970869&rtpof=true&sd=true">Resume</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-edmunds-eecs/">Linkedin</a> )</h2>
                                <p>
                                In graduate school, I worked on various pieces of software - I published a well-known <a href="https://github.com/edmundsj/rcwa/">python package</a> used for certain types of electromagnetics simulations, which uses numpy under the hood to efficiently calculate electromagnetic properties of periodic structures. I also published several other packages, including <a href="https://github.com/edmundsj/liapy">liapy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/edmundsj/sugarplot">sugarplot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/edmundsj/sciparse">sciparse</a>, <a href="https://github.com/edmundsj/ankilol">ankilol</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/edmundsj/scippy">scrippy</a> as well as the hardware and software for various development boards I designed, like <a href="https://github.com/edmundsj/MCP3561DevBoard">this ADC dev board</a> and <a href="https://github.com/edmundsj/temperatureController">this thermoelectric cooler controller</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                After graduate school, I co-founded a software company focused on building a marketplace for electric vehicle repair. My co-founder and I raised $1.2M, I designed, built, and tested our MVP, and hired and managed our first software engineer.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                I am currently a software engineer at Reality Labs Research in Pittsburgh, PA, where I work on our infrastructure team helping to build the DevOps tools to support our research efforts on Codec Avatars.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Passion projects</h2>
                                <h3>YouTube</h3>
                                <p>
                                I maintain an educational <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JordanEdmundsEECS">YouTube channel</a>, where I teach the basics of physics, electrical engineering, and other technical topics. What started off as a way to teach myself various topics has grown into a substantial library and modest source of income.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Medium</h3>
                                <p>
                                I also write on <a href="https://medium.com/@jordan.l.edmunds">Medium</a>, everything from health and wellness to education and learning to software engineering. I also write about and advocate for autistic and disabled people - I myself am autistic.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Software</h3>
                                <p>
                                Most of the software I have written in graduate school and my free time is open-source, which you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/edmundsj/">GitHub</a>.  I am an advocate for open-source software, and have tremendous respect for companies that choose to open-source internal tools or build business around such software. A current project is <a href="https://github.com/edmundsj/ankilol">ankilol</a>, which I use to create flashcards to help me study various topics I like to learn about.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Hobbies and Personal Life</h2>
                                <p>
                                I am an avid backpacker - having hiked through Yosemite up half dome and back, as well as a smattering of shorter trips. I also enjoy rock climbing, both indoors and outdoors. You'll often find me after work playing board games with frineds - especially cooperative ones - with Spirit Island being my current favorite.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                I am currently engaged to my incredible partner Nikole. I moved out to Pittsburgh to support her while she completes her Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon.
